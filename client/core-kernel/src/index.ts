// The domain-free base of a client core, taken from still.fail's (client/core-ts) for other apps to pin by version (the

// its sync runs on, the `doing` of calls under way, the protocol to its UIs and its single-writer SQLite. The UI's side
// (`./client`) and the web's worker relay (`./web-worker`) use no Effect.
