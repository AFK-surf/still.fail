//! The station's Node processes under the launcher, as one state machine for every platform: started, ready, crashed
//! and started again after a backoff that doubles (back to the first once a Node served `stable`), given up after
//! START_FAILURES starts in a row that never got ready, handed over to a new Node beside the old one (where the
//! platform can: Unix's SIGUSR2), drained, stopped (killed when it does not stop in time), stopped with the parent.
//!
//! run.rs (Unix) and run_windows.rs give it their processes (`Os`, `Process`) and tell it what happened (a line from a
//! Node, a Node's end, a stop, a handover asked for); they decide nothing of the lifecycle themselves, so a change to
//! restarts, timeouts or stopping is made here once and tested here once, on every platform.
