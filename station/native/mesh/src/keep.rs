//! From mesh/station/src/keep.rs. The station on every one of still.fail's relays, not only its home one.
//!
//! A relay passes packets on only to whoever is linked to it, and iroh keeps a link only to its home relay (the
//! nearest): one it sends nothing on is let go after a minute. So a station abroad, at home on Cloudflare's relay, was
//! out of reach of a phone in mainland China, which seldom gets through to Cloudflare (2026-10-01, bft in Tokyo); the
//! phone's packets on the other relays went nowhere. iroh 1.x takes one relay transport per endpoint, so a station
//! cannot be at home on several: each relay gets a keeper instead, a small endpoint of its own on that relay alone (no
//! IP), which the station stays connected to through that relay. The connection's keep-alives (iroh's, every 5 s)
//! are the station sending on the relay, so its link there stays up, and a device dialing on any of the relays is heard
//! (the station answers on the relay it heard it on).
