// Claude Code on macOS keeps its login in the keychain, under a name made from its config directory's path, and falls
// back to <config dir>/.credentials.json only when the keychain refuses (the Rust station's no_keychain.rs). A profile's login
// has to live in its home (homes are renamed after a sign-in, quota and checks read the file, the keychain is out of
// reach outside the desktop session). So profile processes get a `security` first on their PATH that finds and stores
// nothing of Claude Code's (exit 44, "not found"); anything else goes to the real one. Machine profiles are not touched.
