// GET /events (the Rust station's admin/events.rs): what changed, as it changes, pushed. Changes that come in a burst go out
// as one event per session, and one round of sidebar rows; a thread's entries go out as they are written; `host` adds
// host samples, `job` a job's output as it grows, `live` sessions as they run. Keepalives and host samples only while
// someone follows. The same event names and data as the Rust station's; each event now also carries an `id:`: this run of
// the station's, and its number in it (`<run>.<n>`), clients from before ignore it.
//
// A client's stream is replaced by another whenever what it follows changes (a session starts or stops running): what
// was told to everyone between the new one being asked for and its being here went only to the old one, and was lost
// where the client let go of the old one before it had read that. So what is told to everyone is kept a while, and a
// stream asked for `since` the last id its predecessor gave is first told again what came after it (the same ids), or
// `missed` when that is not kept any more (or was another run's): the client then reads the station again.
//
// Where the Rust re-read a job's log every second, a log is watched (fs.watch); the sidebar rows of a viewer are read
// once per round for all their streams, off the main thread (the readers).
