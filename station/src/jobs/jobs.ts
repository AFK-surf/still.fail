// Background jobs (the Rust station's jobs.rs): commands a session's agent starts that the station runs and keeps, apart from
// the agent's turns. Each runs in a process group of its own with its output in a log file; the agent hears when it
// ends, and whatever the job says on the way (`stillfail-job notify …`). A job with a port is a web service: kept up
// (started again when it ends, with a growing pause), and seen by the workspace's members through the station's
// /preview. Jobs outlive the station: a restart takes up what still runs, and starts again what does not (the machine
// restarted). They are not run under runners: their own groups and exit files are what lets them outlive it.
//
// Push, not poll: a job this station started is followed by its exit event; one an earlier station started (not its
// child) by its exit file appearing (a watch on jobs/exit), with a look at its leader once a second for the one end
// that writes no file (its shell killed) — Node has no exit event for a process that is not its child.
