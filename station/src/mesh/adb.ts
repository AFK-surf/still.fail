// stream it opens on the phone's connection (the phone's core takes it on to adbd). `adb connect` as the offer comes,
// `adb disconnect` as it goes; `adb pair` through the phone's pairing port when its person types the code. The agents
// read who lent what with the `adb_devices` tool (`Shares.list`, given to tools/adb.ts `adbTools`).
//
// Wire (unchanged from the Rust station; the phone's core is released): a request stream whose head line has an
// `"adb"` object. `op: "share"` is an offer, answered `{status: 200, headers: {content-type: application/x-ndjson}}`
// and then a `{serial, adb, message}` line each time how adb holds the phone changes, for as long as the stream lasts;
// `op: "pair" | "grant"` is an ask, answered with a status and `{message}`. Tunnels are streams the station opens on the
// offer's connection: `{"tunnel": "connect" | "pair"}`, the phone's `{ok: true}` (or `{error}`), then bytes both ways.
