// only some of them still reaches it. Those the cloud adds or takes away are put in or taken out as it pushes them.
// iroh's public relays come in only while none of ours answers (so the station can still be reached; the DHT says
// where), and go once one does again (else iroh may home on a public relay, where browsers can't follow).
