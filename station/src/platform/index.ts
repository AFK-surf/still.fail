// What differs between the machines a station runs on (macOS, Linux, Windows), in this directory and nowhere else:
// the rest of src/ is one logic for all of them, and asks `platform` for what a machine does its own way
// (test/platform.test.ts keeps it so: no process.platform, `win32` or WINDOWS outside src/platform/).
//
// What is asked is what the station means to do (end a job's group, make a command another program can run, join a
// path as Rust does), not which machine this is; a feature only one machine has is a flag saying so (hasKeychain).
