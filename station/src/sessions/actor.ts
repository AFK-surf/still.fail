// One actor per session (the Rust station's session.rs): every change to a session's state runs through its serial queue, so
// runtime events, deliveries and tool calls never interleave halfway. Redesigned on two points (docs/station-ts.md):
// - Where it stands is one value (`phase`): idle, starting, running, waiting, or closed; not three flags kept apart.
// - What tools say of the running turn (its state, need, about, what it waits for) goes through the queue too, and the
//   tool answers once it is recorded: a turn's end comes after the tool's answer, so nothing a tool said is lost.
// Its process is a runner's (src/agents/runner.ts): this actor can go (a station stopping or handing over) and the
// next take it up (`snapshot` / `adopt`), its turn going on all along.
