// Routes chat messages to session actors and creates sessions (the Rust station's hub.rs). Several connects share one hub;
// each has its own chat connection and its own sessions.
//
// A connect's mode decides the sessions: multi-session gives each thread its own session (started by an @mention);
// single-session sends every thread the connect sees into the one session bound to it, which people can switch or
// replace. Either way every message carries its source and the agent names the thread it answers, so a session never
// assumes it belongs to one conversation; replies go out through whichever connect the thread came in on.
//
// Everything said in a thread is recorded once (the store): people's messages are delivered to every session in the
// thread, and what agents and the station post there is recorded after the platform takes it.
//
// The Rust hub is one 2500-line type; here it is this core (actors, routing, holds, handover, eviction) and modules
// beside it, each a group of what the hub does: accounts.ts (which profile), conversations.ts (what agents post and
// read in their chats), others.ts (other chats), messages.ts (session_send), titles.ts, lifecycle.ts (sessions and
// chats made, archived, deleted), review.ts (the archive suggestion). The tools (src/tools/) are built on it.
//
// Redesigned where docs/station-ts.md asks: no settle-by-polling and no handing over of processes: at a handover the
// hub holds turns, waits until every actor's queue has run what it had (`flushed`, pushed, not polled), and snapshots
// every actor into <data>/run/handover.json; the runners keep the processes. A starting hub takes them up from that
// file (`takeUp`), and from the runners a crashed station left (no snapshot), then `recover` resumes the turns marked
// running that nothing took up.
