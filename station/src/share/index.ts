// What this station shares with the other stations of its workspace, and what it uses of theirs
// (docs/station-share.md). It is between the stations only (the station transport, `share.*`, jobs/remote.ts hands
// them here); still.fail cloud says nothing of it beyond which stations are in the workspace.
//
// - The station that has a profile or a skill (its host) keeps who may use it (`allow`, null: every station) and who
//   has a copy or borrows it (state.json `hosted[id].told`: each station and the version it was told of). It tells
//   each station that may use it, directly, when it is shared, changed, moved or no longer shared (share.changed), the
//   ones that did not answer again later.
// - A station that uses one keeps which station it has it from (`share.host` on its profile, state.json
//   `borrowed[id].host`) and asks that station once a run what it is at (share.version), for what changed while it was
//   away.
// - A key profile and a skill: each station that may use it keeps a copy (config.json, <data>/share/<id>/); the host
//   being offline changes nothing for them.
// - A subscription: only its host keeps the login and renews it (a refresh token is spent when used, so two renewing
//   would sign each other out). The others borrow a short-lived access token for each process they start; with the host
//   offline they cannot.
// - Edits to a skill made where it is copied go to its host, which keeps one order of them; one made on an older copy
//   is kept beside the skill as SKILL.conflict-<station>.md.
// - A share moves to another station only from its host, while both are up: it stops lending, hands the profile and
//   its login over, keeps a copy borrowed from the new host, and tells the stations it had told where it went.
//
// Config: a shared profile has `share: {id, allow}` on its host and `share: {id, borrowed: true, host}` where copied
// (made and removed only here). Shared skills are config.json `sharedSkills: {name: {id, allow}}`.
