// A thread is a log of entries that are appended and never changed: an edit is an entry of its own, which readers merge
// into the message it changes. A thread whose sessions are all archived is written out to a zstd file and read from

// What changed is told to subscribers once the method's writes are done (Store::with): the same StoreChange values at
// the same points as the Rust, in the same order.
