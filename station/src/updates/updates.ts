// Which versions this station and the machine's runtimes (Claude Code, Codex) are, whether newer ones are out, and
// updating them from the pages (the Rust station's updates.rs, whose rules this keeps):
// - The station: its release says its version in BUILD (`0.1.<n>`); the latest is what still.fail cloud serves as
//   releases/station.json, or on the test channel (`updateChannel: "beta"` in config.json; a release installed from the
//   beta and not told otherwise is on it) releases/station-beta.json. Switched back from the beta, the older stable
//   release is offered as going back (`downgrade`), only then. It is updated as `stillfail update` does: by the cloud's
//   installer, run apart from the station; only a release that installer put in <data>/app is (the desktop app's
//   comes with the desktop app, a clone's with the clone). With `autoUpdate: true` it does so by itself once the
//   station has been quiet a while (never back from the beta, and a version it already went for, not again).
// - Claude Code and Codex: `--version`, and the latest their npm packages say; updated the way each was installed.
//   Running agents go on with what they started with; the next process starts the new one.
//
// The TS release (docs/station-ts-native.md) is updated by the same installer and the same files as the Rust one:
// run/update.started (this side's, so the process that runs after a handover or restart follows the update to its
// end), run/update.step (download | handoff | drain | restart, the installer's), run/update.log and run/update.exit,
// and the installer is started the same way (STILLFAIL_CHANNEL, STILLFAIL_DATA and EMBER_DATA, `?lang=`). Where it
// differs (see also the report in the station-ts work):
// - The release is `--app` (Paths.app), not two up from dist/admin; BUILD and CHANNEL are read from it the same way.
// - The installer's handoff (swap <data>/app, SIGUSR2 to the pid in run/station.json) reaches the launcher, which
//   starts a new Node from the swapped-in <app>/node/bin/node <app>/station/main.js and lets this one go; the launcher
//   binary itself is not replaced (pid kept: that is what the installer checks). The new Node follows update.started
//   as the Rust binary did after exec. The old Node never sees update.exit (written after the handover).
// - The installer is started in a session of its own (Node's `detached`, setsid) rather than a process group of its
//   own: either way launchd/systemd stopping the station does not take it along.
// - The installer's progress is heard by watching run/ (fs.watch), with a slow look as a safety net and for the
//   drain's count of running turns, in place of a look every second.
// - Words the pages show are kept as catalog keys and said in each reader's language (the Rust said them once, in the
//   language of whoever caused the reading).
// - `stillfail-station channel` reaches this process as the launcher's `{"op":"hup"}` (it holds SIGHUP for it):
//   `answerChannelAsk`.
